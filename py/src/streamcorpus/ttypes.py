  """
  Labels are human generated assertions about a portion of a document
  For example, a human author might label their own text by inserting
  hyperlinks to Wikipedia, or a NIST assessor might record which
  tokens in a text mention a target entity.

  Label instances can be attached in three palces:
   -  Token.labels  list
   -  Sentence.labels  list
   -  ContentItem.labels  map

  Attributes:
   - annotator: identifies the source of this Label
   - target: identifies the information need assessed by annotator
   - offsets: pointers to data to which this label applies.  If empty, then
  label applies to the entire Token, Sentence, or ContentItem to
  which it is attached.
   - positive: Labels are usually positive assertions that the token mentions
  the target_id.  It is sometimes useful to collect negative
  assertions that a token is NOT the target_id, which can be
  indicated by setting Label.positive to False
   - comments: Save notes from Annotator about this Rating
   - mentions: Record strings that are "mentions" of the target in this text.

  Note: there used to be a field 'contains mention' which would
  allow for a document to be labeled as about a thing without
  containing a string naming the thing. That hardly ever actually
  happened, but maybe someday it could be added back if needed.
   - relevance: numerical score assigned by annotator to "judge" or "rate" the
  utility of this StreamItem to addressing the target information
  need.  The range and interpretation of relevance numbers depends
  on the annotator.  relevance can represent a rank ordering or an
  enumeration such as -1=Garbage, 0=Neutral, 1=Useful, 2=Vital
   - stream_id: Stream ID for this label.  This is the stream_id for the source
  StreamItem, if a label is stored independently from its original
  data.
   - flags: General purpose flags. These flags can be used to mark documents
  as meeting an extensible set of criteria.

class Token(object):
  """
  Textual tokens identified by an NLP pipeline and marked up with
  metadata from automatic taggers and possibly also Labels from
  humans.

  Attributes:
   - token_num: zero-based index into the stream of tokens from a document
   - token: actual token string, must always be a UTF8 encoded string, not a
  unicode string, because thrift stores them as 8-bit.
   - offsets: offsets into the original data (see Offset.content_form)
   - sentence_pos: zero-based index into the sentence, which is used for dependency
  parsed data
   - lemma: lemmatization of the token, again must be UTF8
   - pos: part of speech labels defined by Penn TreeBank:
  http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html
  Should probably convert this to an enum, analogous to EntityType
   - entity_type: entity type from named entity recognizer (classifier)
   - mention_id: Identifier for a each mention in this TaggerID's description of
  the document.  Is unique at the document level.  Serves two
  purposes:

    1) Distinguishing multi-token mention.  Needed when the
    entity_type and equiv_id do not change between tokens that are
    part of separate mentions, e.g. "The senator is known to his
    friends as David, Davy, Zeus, and Mr. Elephant."

    2) Refering to mentions used in Relation objects.
   - equiv_id: Within-doc coref chain ID.  That is, identifier of equivalence
  class of co-referent tokens.  Default is -1, meaning None.
   - parent_id: parent sentence_pos in dependency parse. Default is -1, ie None
   - dependency_path: grammatical relation label on path to parent in dependency parse,
  defined by whatever tagger was used -- should pick a canonical
  definition here and convert it to an enum.
   - labels: Labels attached to this token, defaults to an empty map
   - mention_type: Identify the type of mention, e.g. pronoun, description, proper name
   - custom_entity_type: CUSTOM entity type from named entity recognizer (classifier).  If
  used, then entity_type should be set to EntityType.CUSTOM_TYPE,
  i.e. 17.

  This is useful when a specialized tagger has a large number of
  unique entity types, such as entity:artefact:weapon:blunt Rather
  than expand EntityType with many more subtypes, we can escape the
  protection of the enum and just use a string here:

   - media_type: Content-type header from fetching the data, or MIME type
   - clean_html: HTML-formatted version of raw with UTF8 encoding and no broken
  tags.  All HTML-escaped characters are converted to their UTF8
  equivalents.  < > & are escaped.
   - clean_visible: All tags stripped from clean_html and replaced with whitespace,
  so they have the same byte offsets.  The only escaped characters
  are < > &, so that this can be treated as Character Data in XML:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#syntax

  Again: must be UTF8
   - logs: Logs generated from processing pipeline, for forensics
   - taggings: A set of auto-generated taggings, such as a One-Word-Per-Line
  (OWLP) tokenization and sentence chunking with part-of-speech,
  lemmatization, and NER classification.  The string name should be
  the same as the tagger_id and also corresponds to the key in
  sentences or sentence_blobs, which get generated by transforming
  a Tagging.raw_tagging into Sentence and Token instances

  Taggings are generated from 'clean_visible' so offsets (byte,
  char, line) refer to clean_visible and clean_html -- not raw.
   - labels: sets of annotations
   - sentences: parsed Sentence objects generated by an NLP pipeline identified
  by the string name, which is a tagger_id that connects this
  Sentences instance to the Tagging struct from which it came
   - sentence_blobs: same as 'sentences' except the array of Sentence instances are
  serialized into a binary string that can be read by the Thrift's
  binary protocol.  This allows lazy deserialization via an
  iterator -- one sentence at a time.  This might be totally
  unnecessary, because at least some of the Thrift language
  implementations have lazy object construction, e.g. --gen
  py:dynamic,slots
   - language: indication of which natural language is used in the text
   - relations: List of relations discovered in clean_visible
   - attributes: List of attributes discovered in clean_visible
   - external_ids: Map of external identifier strings to mention_ids generated by a
  particular tagger.  This allows external systems to associate
  record IDs with individual mentions, or sets of mentions.

class StreamItem(object):
  """
  This is the primary interface to the corpus data.  It is called
  StreamItem rather than CorpusItem and has a required StreamTime
  attribute, because even for a static corpus, each document was
  captured at a particular time in Earth history and might have been
  different if captured earlier or later.  All corpora are stream
  corpora, even if they were not explicitly created as such.

  stream_id is the unique identifier for documents in the corpus.

  This is similar to the StreamItem defined in kba.thrift for TREC
  KBA 2012, however it removes the 'title' and 'anchor' fields, which
  can now be represented in other_content.  This means that code that
  was written to read messages from kba.thrift must be updated.

  Attributes:
   - version: must provide a version number here
   - doc_id: md5 hash of the abs_url
   - abs_url: normalized form of the original_url, should be a valid URL
   - schost: scheme://hostname parsed from abs_url
   - original_url: string obtain from some source.  Only present if not a valid URL,
  in which case abs_url was derived from original_url
   - source: string uniquely identifying this data set, should start with a
  year string, such as 'news' or 'social'
   - body: primary content
   - source_metadata: see above for explanation of the values that can appear in this
  dictionary of metadata info from the source.  The string keys in
  this map should be short, descriptive, and free of whitespace.
   - stream_id: stream_id is actual unique identifier for a StreamItem.  The
  format is:

  stream_id = '%d-%s' % (int(stream_time.epoch_ticks), doc_id)
   - stream_time: earliest time that this content was known to exist.  Usually,
  body.raw was also saved at the time of that first observation.
   - other_content: such as title, anchor, extracted, etc.  When present, 'anchor',
  is a single anchor text of a URL pointing to this doc.  Note that
  this does not have metadata like the URL of the page that
  contained this anchor.  Such general link graph data may
  eventually motivate an extension to this thrift interface.
   - ratings: doc-level judgments relating entire StreamItem to a Target
   - external_ids: doc-level map connecting either doc_id or stream_id (or both) to
  external identifiers.  This allows external systems to associate
  record IDs with individual doc_id or stream_id of this document.
  The keys in the second level map can be either doc_id or
  stream_id, or possibly other IDs in the future.
